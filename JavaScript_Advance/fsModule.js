// Fs is a inbuilt function in nodejs to perform operations on files

// There are always two ways to do fs operation as sync and async

// Fs library sends data event continuously in this case event emitter comes into picture

// For importing the fs module we have following syntax
const fs = require("fs");

// Here we created a read stream will give output as a object into string
const content = fs.createReadStream("./resources/file/order.txt");

/* If we don't use the encoding as utf8 then it will print data in the form of buffer only

content.setEncoding("UTF8");// This encodes the data into our desired type

// Here we are listing to the event of closing of a file
content.on("open", () => {
  console.log("File opened for reading");
});

// Here we are listening to the event called data which will be called when data is present
content.on("data", (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});

// Here we are listing to the event of closing of a file
content.on("close", () => {
  console.log("File ends");
});

// Output is going to be

// This is a kind of publish , subscribe system our stream is subscriber and file is publisher we can use that using MQTT
