/* 

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) 
with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

/*

function modifyString has two variables sampleString and modifier(function). 
Now when modifyString is invoked, it returns modifier.
Usually, when a function is invoked, the memory allocated to the variables present inside gets freed
by the garbage collector. However, in javascript when a function returns another function
the returned function still has access to those variables. The reference to outer scope/environment
explains closures
