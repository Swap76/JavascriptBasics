# Number Methods

## Number methods allow you to easily work with numbers

**isFinite()** - Checks whether a value is a finite number. 
Finite is a number that isn't infinite and can be measured or given a value.

It only takes a single parameter which is the value you'd like to check. 
It's return value will be a boolean (true or false)

Numbers that pass as finite: 
0
whole numbers
negative numbers
decimals
equations

**isInteger()** - Checks whether the value passed is an integer.
It's return value will be a boolean (true / false)

**isNaN** - Checks whether the value passed is NaN (Not a number) or if the value is a number

true = NaN 

**isSafeInteger()** - Checks whether the method passed is a safe integer. The returned value will provide a boolean.

A safe integer is represented as an IEEE-754 double precision number. This is simply any number between -9007199254740991 and 9007199254740991. 

Note that the value isn't changed to a number if a string is passed in.

**toExponential()** - Converts a number to its exponential form. The returned value is a string that represents the Number object in exponential notation

**toFixed()** - Formats a number using the fixed-point notation. It allows you to format a number with a specific number of digits to the right of the decimal. Numbers will be rounded is ncessary. 

Its return value is a string with the given number using fixed-point notation. If the number given is negative, the return value will be a number and won't be converted into a string.

**toLocaleString()** - Converts a number into a language-sensitive representation of said number. 
It can take in two optional parameters: 
- locales: A string with a language tag (bali, latn)
- options: A set of options for the given locale (curency, style)

The return value is a string.

**toPrecision()** - Converts a number to the specified precision. 

The returned value is in the form of a string. The value will be rounded and padded with 0's if there are not enough digits.

**toString()** - Converts a given number to a string with the specified base number (an integer betwen 2 and 36)

The return value is given in the form of a string if no radix is given.

**valueOf()* - Returns the number value in primitive form of a Number object. 
This is rarely something done on your own, as JavaScript invokes this automatically.
