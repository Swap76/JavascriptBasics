Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.
All the Math functions take input as number. If a number is provided in string format, It is accepted as well,
If a string input is provided like Math.abs("hello") It will output "NaN" ie not a number.

Math.round(number) rounds off the value of number to nearest integer
Math.round(number) takes a single argument that is a number which needs to be rounded off.

Math.pow(x,y) returns base to the exponent power, that is, base^exponent.
Math.pow(x,y) takes two arguments, First argument is the base number and second argument is the power/exponent number. 

Math.sqrt(x) returns square root of the given number.
Math.sqrt(x) takes one argument, the number whose square root needs to be found.

Math.abs(x) returns absolute value of a number.
Math.sqrt(x) takes one argument, the number whose absolute value needs to be found.
